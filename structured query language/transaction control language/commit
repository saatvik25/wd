//Commit
COMMIT command in SQL is used to save all the transaction-related changes permanently to the disk. 
Whenever DDL commands such as INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE are used, 
the changes made by these commands are permanent only after closing the current session.

update employee set name = 'cccc' where id = 3;

commit;
