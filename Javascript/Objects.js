// * Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
// * Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
// * Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
// * Dates are always objects
// * Maths are always objects
// * Regular expressions are always objects
// * Arrays are always objects
// * Functions are always objects
// * Objects are always objects


//with JavaScript you can create an object and assign data to it, like this:


Var person = {name:"John", age:31, city:"New York"};


// You can access a JavaScript object like this

person.name


// Data can be modified like this:

person.name = "Gilbert";
